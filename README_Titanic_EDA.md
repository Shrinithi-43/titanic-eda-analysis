## 📊 What I Did
1. **Loaded the dataset** and performed a basic overview.
2. **Generated summary statistics** (mean, median, std, null values).
3. **Created visualizations**:
   - Histograms and Boxplots for numeric features.
   - Countplots for categorical features.
   - Correlation heatmap.
   - Pairplots to study relationships.
4. **Identified patterns** like class survival rate and gender-based trends.
5. **Detected anomalies and missing values**, visualized with heatmaps.
6. **Made inferences** based on feature distribution and trends.
