# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Task 2, focused on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Titanic dataset.

---

## 📌 Objective

To understand the dataset using statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between features like age, class, gender, and survival.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset

Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## 📊 EDA Summary

- Visualized data distribution using histograms and boxplots.
- Identified missing values and outliers.
- Analyzed survival rates by passenger class and gender.
- Created correlation heatmaps for numerical features.

---

## 🔍 Key Observations

1. Most passengers were from 3rd class.
2. Survival rates were highest in 1st class.
3. Females had significantly higher survival rates than males.
4. Fare was positively skewed with some very high outliers.
5. Age column had missing values needing imputation.
6. `Pclass` and `Fare` were negatively correlated.
